<p>FLP reserves the right to periodically make improvements or changes in its website at any time without any prior notice to the User.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Limited Liability of FLP</strong></strong></p>
<p>Unless FLP explicitly acts as a reseller in certain scenarios, FLP always acts as a facilitator by connecting the User with the respective service providers like airlines, hotels, restaurants etc. (collectively referred to as &ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;). FLP&rsquo;s liability is limited to providing the User with a confirmed booking as selected by the User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any issues or concerns faced by the User at the time of availing any such services shall be the sole responsibility of the Service Provider. FLP will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence on part of any Service Provider.</p>
<p>Unless explicitly committed by FLP as a part of any product or service:</p>
<ul>
<li>FLP assumes no liability for the standard of services as provided by the respective Service Providers.</li>
<li>FLP provides no guarantee with regard to their quality or fitness as represented.</li>
<li>FLP doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the availability of any services as listed by a Service Provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making a booking, User understands FLP merely provides a technology platform for booking of services and products and the ultimate liability rests on the respective Service Provider and not FLP. Thus the ultimate contract of service is between User and Service Provider. User further understands that the information displayed on the Website with respect to any service is displayed as furnished by the Service Provider. FLP, therefore cannot be held liable in case if the information provided by the Service Provider is found to be inaccurate, inadequate or obsolete or in contravention of any laws, rules, regulations or directions in force.</p>
<p><strong><strong>User's Responsibility</strong></strong></p>
<p>Users are advised to check the description of the services and products carefully before making a booking.

FLP may change the features or functionality of the services being provided at any time, in its sole discretion, without any prior notice. FLP expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, reasonably fit for all purposes. No advice or information, whether oral or written, which the User obtains from FLP or through the services opted shall create any warranty not expressly made herein or in the terms and conditions of the services.</p>

<p><strong><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE:</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><u><strong>FLIGHT TICKETS</strong></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Terms Of The Airlines</strong></strong></p>
<p>The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the terms &amp; conditions of the concerned airline, including but not limited to cancellation and refund policies.</p>
<p>FLP merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.</p>
<p>Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior intimation to FLP. As a facilitator FLP has no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.</p>
<p>Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services and price.</p>
<p>The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by the airline, and FLP has no role to play in the same. Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are &ldquo;hand baggage fares&rdquo; which do not entitle the User for free check in baggage and therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check in baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the airlines for detailed costs.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Code Share</strong></strong></p>
<p>Some airlines enter into &ldquo;code share&rdquo; agreements with other Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as &ldquo;operated by&rdquo; in the booking flow.</p>
<p>If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to payment.</p>
<p>FLP will disclose any such code-share arrangements to the User, only when the ticketing airline discloses it to FLP in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>Travel Documents</strong></strong></p>
<p>It shall be the sole responsibility of the User to ensure they are in possession of valid travel documents such as identity proof, passport, visa (including transit visa) etc. to undertake the travel. User agrees that in case of inability to travel for not carrying valid travel documents, FLP shall in no way be held liable.</p>

In such a scenario FLP has no control in the said process nor will be obligated to provide alternate bookings to the User. The cancellation penalty in such an event shall be as per the applicable airline rules.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Changes To Existing Booking</strong></strong></p>
<p>Any changes that are made to any existing booking shall be subject to certain charges levied by the respective airline, apart from the service fee charged by FLP.</p>
<p>The User shall be obligated to pay applicable charges in the event of any alteration or modification to an existing booking. However, depending on the airline&rsquo;s policy and fare class, charges for changes or modifications to existing bookings may vary.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Refund</strong></strong></p>
<p>Refunds will be processed as per the airline fare rules and cancellation policy. Such refunds shall be subject to FLP receiving the same from the airlines. However, the convenience fee paid to FLP paid at the time of booking is a non-refundable fee.</p>
<p>All cancellations made directly with the airline need to be intimated to FLP, in order to initiate the process of refund. The processing time for refunds may vary depending on the mode of payment, bank etc. The refund shall be processed after deducting the FLP service fee which is independent of the convenience fee as mentioned above.</p>

<p><strong><u><strong>VISA SERVICES:</strong></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Role Of FLP And Limitation Of Liability</strong></strong></p>
<p>FLP solely acts as a facilitator for visa processing and is not responsible for grant or rejection of User(s) visa in any manner whatsoever. Issuance of visa is a sole decision of concerned Embassy.</p>

User understands that he is solely liable to understand the requirement of Visa to undertake his travel booked for the desired destination country/Countries and then instruct FLP accordingly to initiate the Visa application process.</p>
<p>FLP role is limited to informing the User about the documentary requirements for applying for a visa of a specific country or jurisdiction, collecting those documents as provided by the User, and submitting those documents to the respective embassy or high commission. Such requirements for making a visa application (including, but not limited to, documentation, fees and time frames) are provided by FLP on the basis of the information provided by the respective embassy or high commission. FLP cannot and will not advise on the merit, completeness, or the suitability of the documents, or the likelihood of approval or rejection of the visa being applied for.</p>

<p>The approval or rejection of visa is at the sole discretion of the respective embassy or the high commission to which the visa application is submitted.

In certain instances, even when a visa is issued, the User may be denied entry as it is the local immigration authorities which have a final say on entry decision.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa certain countries may require additional conditions to be fulfilled. For example, an &ldquo;OK TO BOARD&rdquo; approval may be required for User(s) travelling to Dubai. User understands that it is the complete discretion of the concerned Airline/ department to grant or reject &ldquo;ok to board&rdquo; and FLP has no role to play in this regard. FLP merely acts as a facilitator between the User and the concerned department/ Airlines for application of OK TO BOARD. User(s) are required to provide valid communication details (mobile number/ email id) at the time of applying for the Visa / OK TO BOARD services, as these will be the only point of contact for timely update on the status of User Visa / OK TO BOARD application by FLP.</p>
